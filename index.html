                <h4>Petar's Platform</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preserve integrity of club atmosphere, create a space that people want to get involved in.</li>
                    <li>Get Juniors more involved through a sense of accountability, complete overhaul of Junior exec positions. Some positions will be merged, voting will happen among senior execs in the coming academic year. (Disjoint in levels of responsibility, too many of some position, i.e stock rep)</li>
                    <li>More interaction between Juniors and Seniors, clear expectations from Seniors about what Juniors should be doing</li>
                    <li>Opportunities for Juniors to get more involved via Senior execs</li>
                    <li>For fall AGM, make it clear that involvement needs to be fueled by a want to contribute and take part, not just for padding resumes, etc</li>
                    <li>Push for more club organized events, focus on “meet and greet” type events for earlier in the year, more involved events later in the year</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Shally's Platform</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have more accountability from juniors and seniors</li>
                    <li>Restructure the format of how compE meetings are run so we get more junior input from the meetings</li>
                    <li>More community engagement have more interactions between the computer engineering/comp sci community and the club (i.e more events involving the community)</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Hey guys, I'm Danish and I'm running for CompE club VP External 2018-19. I love being a CompE and the fact that we as CompEs have an opportunity to define how people are gonna live their lives. And locally, how we are defining and 'disrupting' Edmonton's tech community and culture. So as a VP external for compE club, what I wanna achieve is to carry on what CompE club's amazing team has been doing so far; connecting the community with organizing events such as HackED and Hack Time and at the same time bringing us closer to the industry with events like Meet a computer engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
                So here are the main things I wanna achieve this year to make the next few years in Computer engineering better for everyone:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Continue organizing and promoting CompE club Hackathons, Hack Time and any events that help us as a community grow and get stronger</li>
                <li>Maintain the clubs relationship with amazing organizations like Startup Edmonton and promote everything they have been doing so far for our Edmonton's tech community and contribute to their goals and ideas</li>
                <li>Advocate for more independently structured CompE programs. I really don't like the idea of a fixed curriculum which you have to follow and would love access to more electives and at the same time fewer EE courses</li>
                <li>Promote external participation in CompE events and slack channels. I would love to have the club more open to anyone in CompE rather than just the executive team so we could actually have a stronger community and enhance the interaction outside class. I feel like the amount of interaction within the discipline is a bit lacking and would love to change that</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These are some of the things I wanna do this year so if you relate to any of them, join me in doing something about it.

            <p>
                Push the University of Alberta towards being more Computer Engineering oriented, this is mainly by ensuring the coop coordinators network with more software companies, to ensure more employment opportunities for Computer Engineers as the interest in Computer Engineering is increasing every year. Also by trying to remove the mandated co-op resumes that put University of Alberta students at a serious disadvantage compared to students applying to other Universities.

            <img class="img-responsive" height="300" src="media/vpi_thomas.jpg"/>

            <p>
                Hi, I’m Thomas and I’m running for VP Internal. Next year I will be a 5th year software co-op.
            </p>

            <p>
                CompE club has given me many fond memories throughout my degree even though it’s rare to find me in the club room. In 2016/2017 I was the 3rd year representative but then was away on a work term during elections for 2017/2018. Additional experience as a club executive comes from high school where I was the president of Brain Care Youth, a club for volunteering with brain injury survivors.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the responsibilities as VP Internal is the weekly newsletter. I already have exposure to the MailChimp emailing service from my involvement with Learning Beyond Borders so the transition should be relatively seamless.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another responsibility is allocating upgrade funding alongside the faculty. Being a senior student means I have exposure to the majority of lab environments for my discipline and know the kinds of questions to ask peers to gauge their needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe that my previous experience both as a club executive and with the required technologies will allow me to excel in this position, and I hope that you vote for me to be the 2018/2019 VP Internal.
            </p>

            <img class="img-responsive" height="300" src="media/vpi_navras.png"/>

            <p>
                My name is Navras Kamal and I am a second year Computer Nano Engineering Coop student.  I have been a part of the CompE club for the past year as the Marketing Rep and have been involved in many of the events throughout, including the Hackathons and GEER Week.  From this, and with my past experience in film, graphic design and advertising I will be able to use the weekly newsletter to better promote the various events hosted and sponsored by the club.  In addition, I will have an understanding of where resources such as the funding from the EUEF should be allocated, and can effectively scout and obtain the venues we need for our events and meetings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall my experience both in and outside of the club gives me an advantage in this position, making me the ideal candidate for VP Internal.
            </p>
